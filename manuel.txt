Here you can find a small intruduction for [K.I.M] / [A.I.M]

Befor you start! You have to install the following Modules(Win/Mac):
-pynput
-keyboard
-pyautogui

Controll:

s = stats [K.I.M] / [A.I.M]
p = pause [K.I.M] / [A.I.M]
r = resume [K.I.M] / [A.I.M]
esc = stops/ ends [K.I.M] / [A.I.M]
(following keys)

ADVICE!!!

-Sometimes [K.I.M] / [A.I.M] stops working but is still running wothout a error code. Just press "p" and after "r" than it will run normal.
-Also at this current state it will crash if you try to "restart" [K.I.M] / [A.I.M] with the "s"-key. It will think that you try to start the operation agian what leads to
a Crash of [K.I.M] / [A.I.M].
